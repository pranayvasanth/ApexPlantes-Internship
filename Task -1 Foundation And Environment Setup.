1. Cybersecurity Bascis:

  ->  The CIA Triad :

        The CIA Triad forms the foundation of information security, representing three core principles that must be maintained to ensure data security.

🔒 Confidentiality
    Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals and remains protected from unauthorized access.

Key Implementation Methods:

. Authentication mechanisms: Username/password combinations, multi-factor authentication
. Access controls: Role-based permissions, least privilege principle
. Encryption: Data encryption at rest and in transit
. Physical security: Secure storage facilities, locked workstations

Common Attacks:

. Data breaches and unauthorized access
. Card skimming and identity theft
. Keylogging and credential harvesting
. Phishing and social engineering
. Dumpster diving for sensitive documents

🛡️ Integrity
    Ensures that information remains accurate, complete, and unaltered by unauthorized parties during storage and transmission.

Key Implementation Methods:

. Cryptographic hashing: SHA-256, MD5 checksums for data verification
. Digital signatures: Non-repudiation and authenticity verification
. Message Authentication Codes (MAC): Ensuring message integrity
. Version control: Tracking changes and maintaining data consistency

Common Attacks:

. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
. Packet interception and modification
. Data tampering and unauthorized modifications
. Database injection attacks

⚡ Availability
    Ensures that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed, maintaining business continuity.

Key Implementation Methods:

. Redundancy: Backup systems and failover mechanisms
. Load balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple servers
. Disaster recovery: Business continuity planning
. Regular maintenance: System updates and performance monitoring

Common Attacks:

. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
. System outages and infrastructure failures
. Resource exhaustion attacks.


->  Threat Types: 
        A  threat is any potential event or action that could harm a computer system, network, or data by compromising its confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
        These threats can be intentional, such as malware and phishing attacks, or unintentional, like human error or natural disasters.
