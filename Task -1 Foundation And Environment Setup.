1. Cybersecurity Bascis:

👉 The CIA Triad :

        The CIA Triad forms the foundation of information security, representing three core principles that must be maintained to ensure data security.

🔒 Confidentiality
    Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals and remains protected from unauthorized access.

Key Implementation Methods:

. Authentication mechanisms: Username/password combinations, multi-factor authentication
. Access controls: Role-based permissions, least privilege principle
. Encryption: Data encryption at rest and in transit
. Physical security: Secure storage facilities, locked workstations

Common Attacks:

. Data breaches and unauthorized access
. Card skimming and identity theft
. Keylogging and credential harvesting
. Phishing and social engineering
. Dumpster diving for sensitive documents

🛡️ Integrity
    Ensures that information remains accurate, complete, and unaltered by unauthorized parties during storage and transmission.

Key Implementation Methods:

. Cryptographic hashing: SHA-256, MD5 checksums for data verification
. Digital signatures: Non-repudiation and authenticity verification
. Message Authentication Codes (MAC): Ensuring message integrity
. Version control: Tracking changes and maintaining data consistency

Common Attacks:

. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
. Packet interception and modification
. Data tampering and unauthorized modifications
. Database injection attacks

⚡ Availability
    Ensures that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed, maintaining business continuity.

Key Implementation Methods:

. Redundancy: Backup systems and failover mechanisms
. Load balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple servers
. Disaster recovery: Business continuity planning
. Regular maintenance: System updates and performance monitoring

Common Attacks:

. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
. System outages and infrastructure failures
. Resource exhaustion attacks.


👉 Threat: 
        A  threat is any potential event or action that could harm a computer system, network, or data by compromising its confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
        These threats can be intentional, such as malware and phishing attacks, or unintentional, like human error or natural disasters.

⚠️ Threat Types:
     Here are explanations of various common cyber threat types:

    1. Phishing: This is a social engineering attack where attackers attempt to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information (like usernames, passwords, or financial details) by impersonating a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.
                This can occur through emails, messages, or websites designed to look legitimate.

    2. Malware: This is an umbrella term for "malicious software" designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. 
            Common types of malware include:
                    . Viruses: Self-replicating programs that attach to legitimate programs and spread when those programs are executed.
                    . Worms: Self-replicating malware that spreads independently across networks.
                    . Trojans: Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software to trick users into installing them.
                    . Spyware: Software that secretly monitors and collects information about user activity.
                    . Adware: Software that displays unwanted advertisements.

    3. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service): In a DDoS attack, multiple compromised computer systems (a botnet) are used to flood a target server, website, or network resource with an overwhelming amount of traffic.
                                             This overload prevents legitimate users from accessing the service, effectively denying them service.

    4. SQL Injection: This attack exploits vulnerabilities in web applications that use SQL databases. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields (like login forms) to manipulate the database, 
                        potentially gaining unauthorized access to data, modifying data, or executing administrative commands.

    5. Brute Force: A brute force attack involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters to guess a password, encryption key, or other credentials. 
                    Attackers use automated tools to rapidly test numerous possibilities until the correct one is found.

    6. Ransomware: This is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files or locks their computer system, demanding a ransom payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for restoring access. If the ransom is not paid, the data may remain encrypted or be published.

                
👉 Attack Vector :
                An attack vector is a pathway or method used by a hacker to illegally access a network or computer in an attempt to exploit system vulnerabilities. 
                Hackers use numerous attack vectors to launch attacks that take advantage of system weaknesses, cause a data breach, or steal login credentials. 
                Such methods include sharing malware and viruses, malicious email attachments and web links, pop-up windows, and instant messages that involve the attacker duping an employee or individual user.

    🏹 Types of Vector Attacks:
         . Social engineering.
         .  wireless attacks. 
         . insider threats.
            These all common attack vectors, which are pathways attackers use to gain access to systems and data.

    1.  Social engineering: Attacks that rely on human psychology to manipulate individuals into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.

        Examples:
            . Phishing: Sending fraudulent emails to trick people into revealing information.
            . Vishing: Voice phishing, or phone-based phishing.
            . Smishing: SMS phishing, or text message-based phishing.
            . Pretexting: Creating a fabricated scenario to get information. 

    2. Wireless attacks : Attacks that target wireless networks and devices, such as Wi-Fi networks.

        Examples:
            . Rogue access points: Setting up a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot that looks legitimate to intercept data.
            . Packet sniffing: Intercepting and analyzing data packets sent over a wireless network.
            . Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks: Overloading a wireless network with traffic to make it unusable. 
                        
    3. Insider threats: Security risks originating from inside an organization, which can be intentional or unintentional.

         Examples:
            . Malicious insiders: Employees, former employees, or contractors who intentionally cause harm, such as stealing data.
            . Accidental insiders: Employees who, through negligence, cause a data breach, such as accidentally clicking a phishing link or misconfiguring a system. 

Note: Sub-task 3 is in different file , because its easy to acees , and sub- task is not a theoritical task.
