1. Reconnaissance.
2. Port & Service Scanning.
3. Vulnerability Scanning.
4. Packet Analysis with Wireshark.
5. Firewall Basics.

## 1. Reconnissance :
  
### **Definition** : 
  Recconnaissance is the initial phase of a cyberattack or Penetration test where the attacker gathers as much information as possible about a target system, network, or organisation.

  ### Types of Reconnaissance :
  
  **1.Passive Reconnaissance:** 
  
* Gathering information about a target without directly interacting with the target system or network. It's like observing from a distance.

* **Key Characteristic**: Low risk of detection, as it relies on publicly available information (Open-Source intelligence, or OSINT).
     
  **2. Active Reconnaissance:**

* Gather information by directly interacting with the target system or network. This involves sending probes or packets to the target.

* **Key Characteristic**:  Higher risk of detection (it leaves logs), but it often yields more detailed and real-time information.
