# **1. Cybersecurity Basics**

---

## **1.1 CIA Triad**

The CIA Triad represents the three essential pillars of information security.
They form the baseline framework followed globally across organizations.

---

### **1.1.1 Confidentiality**

Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals.

**Implementation Methods**

* Authentication (passwords, MFA)
* Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
* Least privilege enforcement
* Encryption (AES, TLS)
* Physical security controls

**Common Attacks**

* Unauthorized access
* Identity theft
* Credential harvesting
* Phishing-based breaches

---

### **1.1.2 Integrity**

Integrity ensures information remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered.

**Implementation Methods**

* Cryptographic hashing (SHA-256)
* Checksums and data verification
* Digital signatures
* Message Authentication Codes (MAC)
* Version control

**Common Attacks**

* Man-in-the-Middle
* Unauthorized data modification
* SQL injection
* Packet tampering

---

### **1.1.3 Availability**

Availability ensures information and services are accessible to authorized users at all times.

**Implementation Methods**

* Redundancy and failover systems
* Backups and disaster recovery planning
* Load balancing
* Patch and maintenance cycles

**Common Attacks**

* DoS and DDoS
* Resource exhaustion
* System failures
* Network outages

---

## **1.2 Threats**

A threat refers to any event or action with the potential to harm systems, networks, or data by impacting confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

Threats may be:

* **Intentional:** malware, hacking, targeted attacks
* **Unintentional:** human error, misconfiguration, natural incidents

---

### **👉 Common Threat Types**

* Phishing : Deceptive communication designed to steal credentials, financial data, or personal information.

* Malware : Software created to infiltrate, damage, or gain unauthorized access.
**Types Include**
  
* Virus
* Worm
* Trojan
* Spyware
* Adware

* DDoS : Overwhelms a target network/service with excessive traffic, causing downtime.

* SQL Injection : Injects malicious SQL commands to manipulate or extract database information.

* Brute Force : Systematically attempting every possible credential combination.

* Ransomware : Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption.

---

## **1.3 Attack Vectors**

An attack vector is the route or method through which an attacker gains unauthorized access or delivers malicious content.

---

### **1.3.1 Social Engineering**

Exploits human behavior rather than technical vulnerabilities.

**Examples**

* Phishing
* Vishing (voice phishing)
* Smishing (SMS phishing)
* Pretexting

---

### **1.3.2 Wireless Attacks**

Targets weaknesses in Wi-Fi networks and wireless devices.

**Examples**

* Rogue access points
* Packet sniffing
* Wireless DoS

---

### **1.3.3 Insider Threats**

Threats originating from individuals with internal access.

**👉 Types**

* Malicious insiders
* Accidental insiders

**Note**: Sub-task 3 (Linux Fundamentals) is maintained in a separate file to ensure modular access and streamlined reading.
