1. Cybersecurity Basics
👉 CIA Triad

The CIA Triad forms the foundation of information security. It represents the three core principles required to protect systems and data.

🔒 Confidentiality

Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals.

Key Implementation Methods

Authentication (username/password, MFA)

Access controls (RBAC, least privilege)

Encryption (data at rest & in transit)

Physical security (locked workstations, secure rooms)

Common Attacks

Data breaches

Identity theft

Keylogging

Phishing

Dumpster diving

🛡️ Integrity

Ensures information remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered.

Key Implementation Methods

Cryptographic hashing (SHA-256, checksums)

Digital signatures

Message Authentication Codes (MAC)

Version control

Common Attacks

MITM attacks

Packet modification

Data tampering

SQL/Database injection

⚡ Availability

Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed.

Key Implementation Methods

Redundancy & backups

Load balancing

Disaster recovery & BCP

Regular patching and maintenance

Common Attacks

DoS

DDoS

Resource exhaustion

System failures

👉 Threat

A threat is any event/action that could harm systems or data by affecting confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

Threats can be intentional (malware, hacking) or accidental (human error, natural disasters).

⚠️ Threat Types
1️⃣ Phishing

Tricking users into revealing sensitive data through fake emails, websites, or messages.

2️⃣ Malware

Malicious software designed to harm or infiltrate systems.

Common Malware Types

Virus – attaches to programs and spreads

Worms – self-replicating across networks

Trojans – disguised as legitimate software

Spyware – secretly monitors user activity

Adware – displays unwanted ads

3️⃣ DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)

Overwhelming a server with traffic to make it unavailable.

4️⃣ SQL Injection

Injecting malicious SQL commands into input fields to manipulate a database.

5️⃣ Brute Force

Trying every possible password combination using automated tools.

6️⃣ Ransomware

Encrypts the victim’s system/files and demands payment for decryption.

👉 Attack Vector

An attack vector is the route or method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to a system.

Examples include:

Malware

Malicious links

Email attachments

Fake websites

Pop-ups

🏹 Types of Attack Vectors
1️⃣ Social Engineering

Manipulating human psychology to extract information.

Examples:

Phishing – fraudulent emails

Vishing – voice phishing

Smishing – SMS phishing

Pretexting – fake scenarios to gain trust

2️⃣ Wireless Attacks

Targeting Wi-Fi networks and wireless devices.

Examples:

Rogue access points

Packet sniffing

Wireless DoS attacks

3️⃣ Insider Threats

Threats coming from within the organization.

Examples:

Malicious insiders – intentionally leaking/stealing data

Accidental insiders – misconfigurations, clicking phishing links

Note

Sub-task 3 is in a different file for easier access. It is not theory-heavy.
